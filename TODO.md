- Share games across lists so we build up our own data set
- Profile
  - Most recently played
  - Graphs
    - Play time by month / year / week / day
    - Play time by platform / genre
- Physical / digital copy flag
- List sorting
  - Time played
- Profile management

- Update mongodb password
- Prevent duplicate games in a list
- Games not showing after adding until refresh / change filters
- MongoDB validations
- Better add game UI (dialog?)
- List performance with lots of entries?
- Fetch platforms dynamically
- Pipe for friendly platform names / statuses
- Prevent entering more than 60 seconds or minutes
- Choose a random game
- Show time played / currently playing / status in main list view
- Move pipes / services to folders

Future:

- Price paid
- Game notes
