- Server side rendering
- User page
  - Styles
  - Currently playing
  - Most recently played
  - Time stats?
  - Anything additional to add?
- Profile page
  - Styles
  - Profile link not showing up in menu until alias set?
    - Probably related to duplicate error when no alias is set on more than one profile
- Sort by last played (by default)
- Refresh list periodically
- Customize auth0 UI
- Add aria properties to all buttons, etc..
- Blurb for homepage / final banner / link to login / signup
- Update mongodb password
- MongoDB validations
- List performance with lots of entries?
- Add a bunch of fake user profiles, possibly on a regular basis so site looks busy
- Normalize whitespace

Future:

- Price paid
- Game notes
- Default to previous filters when visiting a page
- Graphs of play time by month, etc..
- Fetch platforms dynamically
- Choose a random game (based on filters)
- Filter based on digital / physical copies
- Convert API to typescript :P
- Privacy settings, ie: make page private, don't show activity log in global feed, etc..
- Delete time logs
  - In dialog, or separate page?
