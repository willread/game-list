- Show release date
- Public page
  - Games should be clickable and open non-editable version of Game dialog
- Profile page
  - Styles
  - Profile link not showing up in menu until alias set?
    - Probably related to duplicate error when no alias is set on more than one profile
- Refresh list periodically and when opening Game dialog
- Customize auth0 UI
- Blurb for homepage / final banner / link to login / signup
- What's new section
- Update mongodb password
- MongoDB validations
- Add a bunch of fake user profiles, possibly on a regular basis so site looks busy
- Normalize whitespace
- Update README, add some screenshots and such

Future:

- Pause time logging
- List performance with lots of entries?
- Better color scheme for graphs (Sarah dislikes!)
- Price paid
- Game notes
- Default to previous filters when visiting a page
- Graphs of play time by month, etc..
- Fetch platforms dynamically
- Choose a random game (based on filters)
- Filter based on digital / physical copies
- Convert API to typescript :P
- Privacy settings, ie: make page private, don't show activity log in global feed, etc..
- Delete time logs
  - In dialog, or separate page?
- Server side rendering
- Nice scrollbars for select lists
- Add aria properties to all buttons, etc..
- Convert to universal app for server-side rendering and move api to this codebase
